NotaryChain
===========

NotaryChain Servers begin by providing proof of existence services, but then move on to provide proof of existence of transforms.  A list of such entries can be thought of as a NotaryChain.  A NotaryChain can be used to implement private tokens, smart contracts, smart properties, and more.

NotaryChains leverage the Bitcoin Blockchain, but in a way that minimizes the amount of data actually inserted in the Blockchain.  Thus it provides a mechanism for creating Bitcoin 2.0 services for the trading of assets, securities, commondities, or other complex applications without increasing blockchain "pollution"
