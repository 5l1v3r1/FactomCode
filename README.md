NotaryChain
===========

NotaryChain Servers begin by providing proof of existence services, but then move on to provide proof of existence of transforms.  A list of such entries can be thought of as a NotaryChain.  A NotaryChain can be used to implement private tokens, smart contracts, smart properties, and more.
